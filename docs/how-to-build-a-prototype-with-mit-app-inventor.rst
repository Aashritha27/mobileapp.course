How to Build a Prototype with MIT App Inventor
==============================================

MIT App Inventor is a visual UI and programming environment which allow us to build fully functional visual Android application in a short period of time.

Playing Around the Working Prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To speed you up we have built a working prototype in `this location <http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=5590318435794944>`_. Once you have opened it and launched it in your Android phone, you would see the following screen:

This screen is generated by parsing and extracting infromation from the course `source file hosted in GitHub <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythonicbridge/mobileapp.course/master/docs/index.rst>`_. User may click on the Next button to move to the next page. Alternatively, he / she can click on the Module button to show the module list like below.

Questions / Exercise for You
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please try the following exercises to faciliate your learning:

#. Try testing the app by clicking the Next button in the mobile app, and check if the corresponding Next page is shown. As a cross-check you can refer to this course web site. The Next button in the mobile app and the course web site should be the same.
#. Open the blocks view for the mobile app, can you locate the logic for deciding which page is the next page?
#. Based on what you have observed by testing and readind the code, in your own words, can you describe the algorithm of deciding which page is the next page?
#. Visit the `Tree Traversal Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal>`_. Do you think our logic for deciding the next page is better to be described as Breath-first or Depth-first? Is the logic traversing by pre-order, in-order, or post-order?
#. As a `Minimum Viable Product <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>`_, we have chosen not to implement logic for displaying image as well as support for Prev button. As a programming exercise, can you help implementing them? You may start from `this location <http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=5590318435794944>`_ for the starter code and remix it on your own.
