Questions / Exercise for You
============================

Please try the following exercises to faciliate your learning:

#. Try testing the app by clicking the Next button in the mobile app, and check if the corresponding Next page is shown. As a cross-check you can refer to this course web site. The Next button in the mobile app and the course web site should be the same.
#. Open the blocks view for the mobile app, can you locate the logic for deciding which page is the next page?
#. Based on what you have observed by testing and readind the code, in your own words, can you describe the algorithm of deciding which page is the next page?
#. Visit the `Tree Traversal Wikipedia Page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal>`_. Do you think our logic for deciding the next page is better to be described as Breath-first or Depth-first? Is the logic traversing by pre-order, in-order, or post-order?
#. As a `Minimum Viable Product <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product>`_, we have chosen not to implement logic for displaying image as well as support for Prev button. As a programming exercise, can you help implementing them? You may start from `this location <http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?galleryId=5590318435794944>`_ for the starter code and remix it on your own.
