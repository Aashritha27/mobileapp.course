What's Next
===========

By this module, you should have built a fully functional Mobile Learning App, which maintains its course content dynamically from GitHub, such that it is generic and flexible. Well done!

One more thing that we would like to do is to show how to compile the Kivy app into a standalone APK Package that can be uploaded to Google Play store.

Also, we would like to discuss the possibility to extend the Mobile Learning App by, for instance, the possibility to include a programming quiz module as future work (we would likely not to implement it due to time constraint).

Then we would end this course by wrapping up what we have learnt, plus some additional resources for you to go further.

Let's begin :)
