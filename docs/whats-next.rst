Final Project
=============

By this module, you should have built a fully functional Mobile Learning App, which maintains its course content dynamically from GitHub, such that it is generic and flexible. Well done!

One more thing that we would like to do is to show how to compile the Kivy app into a standalone APK Package that can be uploaded to Google Play store.

Also, we would like to discuss the possibility to extend the Mobile Learning App by, for instance, the possibility to include a programming quiz module as future work. Due to the time constraint we will leave this as a final project for the students as planned :)

Let's begin :)
