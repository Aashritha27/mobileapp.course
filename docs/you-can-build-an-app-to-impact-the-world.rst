You Can Build an App to Impact the World
========================================

Welcome to the age that everyone can build an app to impact the world. Building an app has becoming very easy, fun, and very meaningful than ever.

One of the most meaningful app that you can build is a mobile learning app. By building a mobile learning app, you can not only learn the aspects of computer science and programming, but also help other people by contributing the education community. In other words, you can teach by learning and sharing!

Is it ever possible? In here we would introduce the story of Amol Bhave, a student from India who built his own MOOC class at his age of 17 that `impressed MIT and featured in MIT News <http://news.mit.edu/2013/6003z-signals-a-new-open-education-ecosystem>`_.  He build his own class just right after he has learnt something and found there is no other course which can fulfill his desire to learn deeper. His class then became very successful with about `1,000 students participating in it <http://blog.edx.org/amol-bhave>`_. 

We believe you can also do that. Let's learn and build your own mobile learning app!
