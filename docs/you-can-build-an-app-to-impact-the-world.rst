You Can Build an App to Impact the World
========================================

(WIP) In here we would introduce the story of Amol Bhave, a student from India who built his own MOOC class at his age of 17 that `impressed MIT and featured in MIT News <http://news.mit.edu/2013/6003z-signals-a-new-open-education-ecosystem>`_. His class then became very successful with about `1,000 students participating in it <http://blog.edx.org/amol-bhave>`_. We would like to mention that Amol's contribution, regardless of its scale, is as unique as what big players like MIT OpenCourseWare, Khan, or Udacity have been doing.

You can also build your own course, and even your own mobile learning app. Interested? Let's get started.
