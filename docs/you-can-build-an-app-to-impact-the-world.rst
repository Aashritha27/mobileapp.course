You Can Build an App to Impact the World
========================================

Welcome to the age that everyone can build an app to impact the world. Building an app has becoming very easy, fun, and very meaningful than ever.

One of the most meaningful app that you can build is a mobile learning app. By building a mobile learning app, you can not only learn the aspects of computer science and programming, but also help other people by contributing the education community. In other words, you can teach immeidately what you have just learn!

Is it ever possible? In here we would introduce the story of Amol Bhave, a student from India who built his own MOOC class at his age of 17 that `impressed MIT and featured in MIT News <http://news.mit.edu/2013/6003z-signals-a-new-open-education-ecosystem>`_. His class then became very successful with about `1,000 students participating in it <http://blog.edx.org/amol-bhave>`_. 

We believe you can also do that. Let's learn and build your own mobile learning app!
