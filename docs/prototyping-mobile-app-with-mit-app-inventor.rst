Prototyping the Mobile App with MIT App Inventor
================================================

(WIP) The objective of this module is to let student to rapidly prototype the Mobile Learning App with MIT App Inventor. App Inventor is a good way to let you to start learning programming quickly by visual blocks and event-driven programming paradigm.

App Inventor allows you to learn how to build prototype to capture and validate user requirements. This prototype is something that you can refer to later on when you implement a more complete version of the app by Python.

At this point, only certain visual components are in-scope for Prototype, with simple synchronization of course content from GitHub are implemented.
