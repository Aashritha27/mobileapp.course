Exercise: Adding Support for Images
===================================

As a exercise, let's add a feature to support images. For simplicity, we can simply extract the URL of the image and open it like we have done for hyperlink. Please do the following simialr to what we have done for hyperlink

#. Create a feature branch feature/image
#. Write a function format_image(self, line). When you can see '.. image : hyperlink.png' in the line, return [ref=https://github.com/pythonicbridge/mobileapp.course/raw/master/docs/hyperlink.png]hyperlink.png: Click to view[/ref]
#. Build a Unit Test to test the feature.
#. Integrate the new function into the main.py.
#. Commit your change locally.
