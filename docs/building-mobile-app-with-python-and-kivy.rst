Building the Mobile App with Python and Kivy
============================================

(WIP) In last module you have learnt how to build a prototype by App Inventor. In this module, you will start learning how to build our mobile app in Python.

In this module, you will learn how to download and setup a Virtual Box Ubuntu Linux image and proceed to the Kivy Mobile App SDK and PyCharm Community IDE installation. You may also learn how to use Git and GitHub to get the starter code for the mobile app and work on it.

We will guide you to complete these activities step-by-step. Let's get started :)
