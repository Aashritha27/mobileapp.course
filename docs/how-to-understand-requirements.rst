How to Understand Requirements
==============================

Understanding requirements is the first and important steps to build our mobile app successfully. In fact, it is an essential stepping stone for every software project to be succesful.

At high level, we need to know the following factors to understands the requirements of an app:

# Who are the stakeholders of the app? 
# How do their existing way of accomplishing their needs / goals / tasks?
# What are their "pain points"?
# What are their budget to solve their "pain points", including how much time / cost can they afford to build and operate the solution?

Then, we may proceed to

# Analysis the requirements and propose our work
# Prototyping our app to get feedbacks from our stakeholders
# Building, testing, getting further feedbacks from our stakeholders and keep improving.

Let's begin by understanding who are the stakeholders of our app and how do they work.
