===============================================

The mobile learning app fetch the course content from GitHub and present it to the user. Navigation menu including Home, Up, and Next are working the similar way like our Prototype. Unlike the prototype, as `Kivy label supports ref and other markups <https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.core.text.markup.html>`_, we can embed the menu directly into the document such that it looks more natural.
