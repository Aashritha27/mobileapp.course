Who Are the Stakeholders of Our App and How Do They Work
========================================================

Let's begin by taking a look on how the following stakeholders use this course web site:

#. Teachers would update course material via `GitHub <https://github.com/pythonicbridge/mobileapp.course/tree/master/docs>`_.
#. Students would visit `the course home page <http://pythonic-cs1-build-a-mobile-app.readthedocs.io/>`_ to access the course content.
