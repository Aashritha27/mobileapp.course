Final Project: Implement a Programming Quiz in Our Mobile Learning App
======================================================================

Recall the steps we need to implement a new feature to our app:

#. Understand our requirements.
#. Implement the user interface.
#. Write a test case.
#. Implement the test case to pass the test.
#. Integrate our change.

We will follow the steps exactly to implement the programming quiz feature. Due to the time constraints, for now we will disucss the high level design and leave the actual implementation as an exercise for the students.
