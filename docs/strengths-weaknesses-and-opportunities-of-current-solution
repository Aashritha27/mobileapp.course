Strengths, Weaknesses, and Opportunities of Current Solution
============================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Strengths of Current Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Git and GitHub provides a platform for teachers to concurrently author the content, and have all changes versioned.
#. GitHub and ReadTheDocs works perfectly together to continously push the latest content available to the learners.
#. GitHub and ReadTheDocs are free, such that there is no cost of hosting and no server to be maintained.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Weaknesses of Current Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. GitHub and ReadTheDocs can only host static content, which limits the interactivity of the course. As a programming class it is ideal to allow students editing and running programming quiz without leaving the course. Existing in-browser solutions are either `lack of 3rd party libraries support<http://www.skulpt.org/>`_, or `requires running and maintaining expensive servers<http://runestoneinteractive.org/>`_, which are not ideal to be plugged into the our current solution.
#. The current solution is web-based, and is inheriently less responsive than mobile app.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Opportunities to Improve Current Soution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Build a mobile learning app which synchronize static content from GitHub / ReadTheDocs, and run programming quizzes inside mobile device.
